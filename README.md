# üõ°Ô∏è SOC Automation Lab

A hands-on project that simulates a modern blue-team SOC environment using a fully automated detection and response pipeline. Designed for aspiring SOC analysts and blue-team enthusiasts, this lab demonstrates how to integrate tools like **Wazuh**, **Sysmon**, **Shuffle**, **TheHive**, and **VirusTotal** into a streamlined, automated workflow capable of detecting, enriching, and responding to real-world threats like **Mimikatz**.

## üß† Overview

The goal is to build an automated mini-SOC lab from scratch, where:

- Sysmon collects telemetry data from a Windows machine.
- Wazuh detects suspicious behavior using custom rules.
- Shuffle automates enrichment and responses.
- TheHive receives structured incidents for case management.
- Email alerts notify analysts in real-time.



## üîß Tools Used

| Tool       | Purpose                                      |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Wazuh**  | SIEM platform for log collection and alerting |
| **Sysmon** | Windows event logging for telemetry           |
| **TheHive**| Incident response & case management           |
| **Shuffle**| SOAR platform for automation workflows        |
| **VirusTotal** | Threat intelligence enrichment (hashes)  |
| **Windows 11**| Endpoint for attack simulation             |
| **DigitalOcean** | Cloud platform to host Linux services  |



## Setting Up the SOC Lab

### 1. Deploy Windows 11 Client (Locally)

- Installed **Sysmon** using SwiftOnSecurity‚Äôs configuration.
- Modified Wazuh agent's `ossec.conf` to forward Sysmon logs:
  ```xml
  <localfile>
    <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
    <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
  </localfile>
  ```

### 2. Deploy Wazuh Manager on DigitalOcean

- Deployed **Ubuntu 22.04 Droplet** on DigitalOcean.
- Installed Wazuh using the official script:
  ```bash
  curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.7/wazuh-install.sh
  sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
  ```
- Registered the Windows endpoint using Wazuh Agent.

### 3. Install TheHive on DigitalOcean

- Launched a second **Ubuntu 22.04 Droplet** on DigitalOcean.
- Installed dependencies:
  - **OpenJDK**, **Cassandra**, **Elasticsearch**, and **TheHive**
- Created an admin user and generated an API key for automation.



## Simulating Attacks and Automation

### Simulating Credential Dumping with Mimikatz

1. Added an exception in Windows Defender for the `Downloads` folder.
2. Renamed `mimikatz.exe` to `you_are_awesome.exe` to simulate stealthy malware behavior.
3. Executed it to generate telemetry logs via Sysmon.

### Enabling Archive Logging in Wazuh

To log *all* data (not just alerts):

```xml
<logall>yes</logall>
<logall_json>yes</logall_json>
```

Also modified Filebeat config on the Wazuh server:
```yaml
archives:
  enabled: true
```

Created a new Kibana index pattern:
- `wazuh-archives-*`
- Time field: `@timestamp`



## Architecture

## Detection Rule for Mimikatz

### Why?
Even if the executable is renamed, the internal metadata reveals its original identity.

### Wazuh Custom Rule:
```xml
<rule id="100002" level="15">
  <if_group>sysmon_event1</if_group>
  <field name="win.eventdata.originalFileName" type="pcre2">(?i)mimikatz\.exe</field>
  <description>Mimikatz usage detected</description>
  <mitre>
    <id>T1003</id>
  </mitre>
</rule>
```

- Placed in `/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`
- Restarted Wazuh Manager to apply changes.



## Automation with Shuffle

### Webhook Setup

- Created a Shuffle workflow.
- Added **Webhook trigger node**.
- Modified Wazuh integration:
```xml
<integration>
  <name>custom</name>
  <hook_url>https://your-shuffle-webhook</hook_url>
  <rule_id>100002</rule_id>
</integration>
```

### Extracting Hash with Regex

- Used the `Rex` app in Shuffle to extract SHA256:
```regex
sha256=([a-fA-F0-9]{64})
```



## Threat Intelligence Enrichment

### VirusTotal in Shuffle

- API used to fetch file reputation using SHA256.
- Output:
  - File name
  - Detection count (malicious/total)
  - File type
  - Antivirus flags

Example:
```
SHA256: abcd...
Malicious Detections: 21/70
File: mimikatz.exe
```



## Case Management and Alerting

### TheHive Integration

- Connected via API key.
- Shuffle workflow creates a **new case** in TheHive.
- Case includes:
  - Hostname
  - IP address
  - Timestamp
  - User
  - Rule ID & severity

### Email Alert

- Configured Shuffle‚Äôs Email app.
- Sent real-time alerts with threat context.
- Subject: `Mimikatz Alert on [hostname]`
- Includes VirusTotal summary + attacker details.
